-- A problem solving approach !!!
-- Optimization over Recursion !!!

       
    Techniques used for DP :

    1) Memoization(Recursive) : 

        -- Create an array/vector of size (input size + 1) or unordered_map and pass it to a recursive function to store the results
           of subproblems. This allows for direct retrieval of results for the same subproblems without the need to
           recalculate them.

        -- Can lead to stack overflow if problem is very very large (recursive stack size allows upto 10^4 records only)


    2) Tabulation(Iterative) :

        -- Create an array/vector of size (input size + 1) and assign meaning to each index. Begin solving from the
           smaller subproblems and progress towards the larger subproblems by using the results of previous
           subproblems, until reaching the given bigger problem !!! 

        -- Faster than memoization(recursive) but harder to come up with its approach.
