// https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-largest-element-in-an-array/description/ (kth smallest element in array using priority queue)


// It is a type of queue where elements are put inside the queue according to its priority :)

// Elements with minimum value/maximum value can be chosen as of highest priority :)

// Default Priority Queue is implemented with maxHeap but we can make it minHeap with some techniques :)

// Insertion of a element in a n-size pq can take O(logn) worst case TC

// Deletion of a element from a  n-size pq can take O(logn) worst case TC

// SC : O(n) , where n is no. of elements inside the pq

// Its implementation is done with the help of Tree DataStructure so please take good knowledge of trees to understand its implementation :)
