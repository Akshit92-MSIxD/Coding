// Diameter of a Tree : Maximum no. of edges/maxDistance between any two nodes in the given tree !!! 
// *** Those two nodes can be either "two leaf nodes(deepest nodes)" or "one root node and one leaf node" !!!

// *** Note : It is not necessary that diameter length will always pass from root node !!!
// *** Hint : related with maxDepth of tree !!!
